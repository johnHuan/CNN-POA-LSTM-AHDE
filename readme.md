There are 21 datasets in total. These include four sets of data from each of the four experimenters (with step counts of 30, 50, 100, and 200 steps), three sets of 100-meter data for calculating the k-value, as well as one set of 100-meter data and one set of basketball court(Rectangular Validation) experiment data.
The 1-3 cols are acceleration data, we established a new approach, local optimum step detection method based on thresholds and differences in peak and valley counts, for detect stride frequency, determine k value for stride length.
The 10-12 cols are gyroscope data, we constructed CNN-POA-LSTM algorithm to predict three axis gyroscope data, Quaternions initialization and Solving heading information, Kalman Filter for Heading Correction.
